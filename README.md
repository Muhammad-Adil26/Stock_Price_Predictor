Stock Price Predictor using LSTM and TensorFlow

This project predicts stock prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, implemented with TensorFlow and Keras, to analyze and forecast future stock prices based on historical data fetched from the Alpha Vantage API.

Key Features:

Data Collection: Retrieves historical stock price data using the Alpha Vantage API.
Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization and feature engineering for model input.
LSTM Model: Uses a sequential LSTM model to predict stock prices based on previous 60 days of data.
Prediction & Visualization: Predicts stock prices and visualizes actual vs predicted data using Matplotlib.

Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow & Keras (LSTM model)
Alpha Vantage API (Data source)
Pandas (Data handling)
NumPy (Numerical operations)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
